## react-piano

A simple piano app, created in React.

It uses configurable key groups ('Three Key' and 'Four Key'), and each key can be configured to use a particular note.

It attempts to shrink/grow somewhat to screen size.

Still a work-in-progress :) Feel free to modify as you like! 

Animations and demo page coming next.
