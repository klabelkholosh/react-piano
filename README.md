## react-piano

A simple piano app, created in React.

Still a HUGE HONKING work-in-progress :) Documentation, and basic key-press / mouseon/off stuff needs to be done properly. Eventually, one day, animations and the like.

Demo [here](https://react-piano-1076c.firebaseapp.com/).

It uses configurable key groups ('Three Key' and 'Four Key'), and each key can be configured to use a particular note.

It attempts to shrink/grow somewhat to screen size.
